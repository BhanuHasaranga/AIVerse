## 💡 **What is AIVerse?**

AIVerse transforms complex AI and machine learning concepts into interactive, visual experiences. Instead of reading about algorithms, you **interact** with them. Adjust parameters, upload data, and watch mathematical concepts come alive through real-time visualizations.

**Perfect for:**
- 🎓 Students learning ML fundamentals
- 💻 Developers transitioning to AI
- 👨‍🏫 Educators teaching data science
- 🚀 Anyone curious about how AI really works

## 🎨 **Built with Modern Architecture**

AIVerse uses a **component-based architecture** inspired by modern web frameworks:

```
📦 Reusable Components
├── 🎨 Theme System (centralized styling)
├── 📦 UI Components (layouts, cards, panels)
├── 📥 Data Components (input forms, displays)
└── 📊 Chart Components (visualization wrappers)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Consistent user experience
- Easy to extend with new modules
- 40% less code through component reuse

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
